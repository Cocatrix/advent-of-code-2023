# advent-of-code-2023

I'm stopping for this year - at least in December. I really like this challenge but it takes too much time for me

Let's have fun

Private leaderboards where I'm included:

100% Swift with playgrounds - Kotlin next year?

I have prewritten tool functions for parsing, logging, they will be in each solution in separated files for clarity

To read the solutions, you can browse `master` by commit, or focus on `Content.swift` files
